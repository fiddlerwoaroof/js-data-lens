* Intro

What is this? Some minimal functional programming utilities imitating
the api of [[https://github.com/fiddlerwoaroof/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs.d/packages/fwoar-functional-utils.el][fwoar-functional-utils.el]] and [[https://github.com/fiddlerwoaroof/data-lens][data-lens]] to enable easy
translation of transformations between elisp, common lisp and
javascript.  These functions all follow the convention where they are
first called with the "secondary" arguments to the operation and then,
next, they are called with the data structure to operate on. This enables
a compositional style, without the overhead of something like Ramda's
currying.
